## Project Overview

**Purrilous Journey** is inspired by the original *Age of War* game. The goal is to defeat the opposing army by continually spawning units, destroying the enemy base, and evolving your civilization to access more powerful troops. Here, every unit, building, and evolution is cat-themed, featuring humorous references and pun-filled content.

**Key highlights**:
- Cat-themed troops and structures (e.g., **Meowlinger**, **Fur-ocious Warrior**, **Tiger Tank**, etc.)  
- Increasingly powerful evolutions that unlock new eras (and new cat designs)  
- Balanced resource management for spawning and upgrading units  
- Lighthearted animations and sound effects aimed at a fun, casual experience
